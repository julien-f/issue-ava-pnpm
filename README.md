WARNING: `npm link ava` and the `--preserve-symlink` flag are incompatible. We have detected that AVA is linked via `npm link`, and that you are using either an early version of Node 6, or the `--preserve-symlink` flag. This breaks AVA. You should upgrade to Node 6.2.0+, avoid the `--preserve-symlink` flag, or avoid using `npm link ava`.
